# Wordle
Worlde Game


The World Project works the exact same as the World game that many of us play on our smart devices. A word is picked from a system of input set my the owner of the game
and the user has 5 attempts to guess the word. A different indication is given for each letter of the word the user guesses depending on if the letter is in the word 
and in the right position, in the word but wrong position, and not in the word at all.
